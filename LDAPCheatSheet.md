   - `ldapadd`: Add new entries to the LDAP directory.
   - `ldapmodify`: Modify existing entries in the LDAP directory.
   - `ldapdelete`: Delete entries from the LDAP directory.
   - `ldapwhoami`: Check authentication against the LDAP server.
   - `slappasswd`: Generate hashed passwords for LDAP.
   - `slapd`: Start or stop the LDAP server daemon.
   - `ldapmodify`: Modify LDAP entries.
   - `ldapmodify`: Delete LDAP entries.
   - `ldapmodify`: Add LDAP entries.  
   - `ldapwhoami -x -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com -W`: dispalys the info of the current authenticated person  
   - `sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd`: configurs the BASE DN and Orgination name  
   - `sudo slapcat`: Displays the config of LDAP

        -   `-x`: specifies the auth method that will be used to authenticate the user trying to excute the command, `-x` means use *Simple bind* for auth, which means just prompt the user for password and transfer it via plain text  
        -   `-Y EXTERNAL`: This another method called `SASL` for auth uses external auth methods, like `Fingerprint and biometric`, `API tokens`..etc
        -   Usually the options which used to specify auth method must be accompnied with the option `-W` which will prompt the user to enter his password.
    -   `sudo ldapwhoami -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -Q`: this uses `-Y EXTERNAL`
   - `sudo slappasswd`: Generates a hash for a password

-   LDAP is a protocol that allows applications to interact with directories.  
It provides a standardized way to access and manage directory information.  
When we say “directory-based,” we mean that LDAP operates within this context of structured data storage and retrieval.    

-   ***Managing Directory Information***  
**When we talk about “managing directory information,” we mean:**
    -   Storing Data: Adding, updating, or deleting entries and their attributes within the directory.
    -   Retrieving Data: Quickly finding relevant information based on search queries.  
    -   Authentication and Authorization: Verifying user identities and controlling access to directory resources.  
    -   Schema Definition: Defining the structure of entries (what attributes they can have).
    -   Access Control: Setting permissions for who can read or modify specific entries.  

-   ***Use Cases for Directories***  
    -   User Authentication: LDAP is commonly used for user authentication (e.g., logging in to systems, applications, or networks).
    -   Address Books: Directories store contact information for users (names, email addresses, phone numbers).
    -   Organizational Data: Details about employees, departments, roles, and resources within an organization.
    -   Device Management: Managing printers, servers, network devices, and other resources.
    -   Global Catalogs: In large networks, directories provide a global view of all resources.
