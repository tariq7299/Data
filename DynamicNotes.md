To configure LDAP with Ranger UserSync, you need to set several properties in the `install.properties` file located in the `/usr/local/ranger-2.4.0-usersync` directory. Here are the most necessary and basic values:

1. **SYNC_SOURCE**: This should be set to `ldap` to tell UserSync to sync users and groups from an LDAP server.

2. **SYNC_LDAP_URL**: This is the URL of your LDAP server. The format of the URL is `ldap://hostname:port`.

3. **SYNC_LDAP_BIND_DN** and **SYNC_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD**: These are the Distinguished Name (DN) and password of a user that has permission to search for users and groups in your LDAP directory.

4. **SYNC_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASE** and **SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_BASE**: These are the search bases that UserSync should use to find users and groups in your LDAP directory.

5. **SYNC_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_FILTER** and **SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER**: These are the search filters that UserSync should use to find users and groups in your LDAP directory.

Please replace the placeholders with the actual values from your LDAP server. If you're unsure about these details, please check with your system administrator or the person who set up the LDAP server¹²³⁴.

To configure LDAP in the `install.properties` file for Ranger UserSync, you'll need to set several basic properties related to LDAP connectivity and user/group synchronization. Here are the most necessary and basic properties to set:

```properties
# LDAP Configuration
SYNC_SOURCE=ldap
SYNC_LDAP_URL=ldap://your_ldap_server:389   # LDAP server URL
SYNC_LDAP_BIND_DN=cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com   # LDAP Bind DN (Distinguished Name)
SYNC_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=your_ldap_password   # LDAP Bind Password
SYNC_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASE=ou=users,dc=example,dc=com   # LDAP User Search Base
SYNC_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_SCOPE=sub   # LDAP User Search Scope (sub for subtree)
SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_BASE=ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com   # LDAP Group Search Base
SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_SCOPE=sub   # LDAP Group Search Scope (sub for subtree)
SYNC_LDAP_USER_NAME_ATTRIBUTE=uid   # LDAP User Name Attribute
SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE=cn   # LDAP Group Name Attribute
```

Explanation of the properties:

- `SYNC_SOURCE`: This property specifies the synchronization source. Set it to `ldap` to indicate that Ranger UserSync will synchronize with an LDAP server.
- `SYNC_LDAP_URL`: Specifies the LDAP server URL.
- `SYNC_LDAP_BIND_DN`: Specifies the LDAP Bind DN (Distinguished Name) used to connect to the LDAP server.
- `SYNC_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD`: Specifies the password associated with the LDAP Bind DN.
- `SYNC_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASE`: Specifies the LDAP base DN where user objects are located.
- `SYNC_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_SCOPE`: Specifies the LDAP search scope for user objects (usually `sub` for subtree).
- `SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_BASE`: Specifies the LDAP base DN where group objects are located.
- `SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_SCOPE`: Specifies the LDAP search scope for group objects (usually `sub` for subtree).
- `SYNC_LDAP_USER_NAME_ATTRIBUTE`: Specifies the LDAP attribute used to identify users (commonly `uid` or `sAMAccountName`).
- `SYNC_LDAP_GROUP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE`: Specifies the LDAP attribute used to identify groups (commonly `cn` or `sAMAccountName`).

Ensure that you replace the placeholder values (`your_ldap_server`, `dc=example,dc=com`, `cn=admin`, `ou=users`, `ou=groups`, `uid`, etc.) with the actual values corresponding to your LDAP configuration.

After setting these properties, you can save the `install.properties` file and start Ranger UserSync to synchronize user and group information with your LDAP server.
