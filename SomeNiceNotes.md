## Hadoop Configuration

**core-site.xml**: This file is a part of the Hadoop configuration files, which are used to inform the Hadoop daemon where the NameNode (the centerpiece of an HDFS file system) runs in the cluster³⁴. It contains settings for Hadoop Core, such as I/O settings, that are common to HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and MapReduce³⁴. These settings are crucial for the proper functioning of a Hadoop cluster³⁴.

**NameNode**: In Hadoop, the NameNode is the master node that manages the file system metadata. Each cluster has a single NameNode, and if that machine crashes, the entire Hadoop system goes down³⁴.

**Hadoop Core**: This refers to the basic components of the Hadoop system, including the Hadoop Common (libraries and utilities), HDFS, and MapReduce³⁴.

**HDFS and MapReduce**: HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications, while MapReduce is a computational model that allows for processing large data sets in parallel³⁴.
