Heavily revised with new recommended procedures for building ISOs for Windows 11 ARM. The

faster, and more reliable than the uupdump procedures.

Version 11 of this Guide which remains available on the VMware Fusion Documents forum.

VMware Fusion Documents forum.

VMs. Ubuntu has broken their kernel once again with an update, and procedures have been 
included to provide a workaround..

Re-introduction of instructions for building the "mainline" utility for installing 
alternate kernels in an Ubuntu VM. This was required as part of the workaround to Ubuntu 
22.10 recent kernel issues.

utility that works around an issue that caused ISO builds from uupdump.net to fail on 
macOS systems.

that required open source utilities have been installed from either Appendix B (Homebrew) 
or Appendix C (MacPorts).

----------------------------------------
Version 7	24-Jan-2023
----------------------------------------

Addition of a "known good distribution" list earlier in the guide. That may help users new 
to Fusion 13 to select a distribution.

Update to the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed installation and upgrade issues noted in version 6 of

20221219 and later. The bug prevents installation from newly download installer ISOs, 
and breaks existing VMs updating to the latest Tumbleweed snapshot. This bug is not 
exclusive to Fusion on Apple Silicon. It impacts any physical and virtual ARM64 
architecture installation.

Fixed some typos in the Ubuntu 22.04.1 download links. The links work properly but the 
descriptive text in the table had some fat-fingered version numbers.

----------------------------------------
Version 5	29-Dec-2022
----------------------------------------

Details on the requirements for 3D support on Linux guests has been added, filling in the 
missing pieces that VMware did not include in the release notes or documentation. Several 
questions about this have been asked recently in the forums.

section and enhanced, as it impacts all guests.
